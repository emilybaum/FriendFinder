# FriendFinder aka Stranger Friend Finder
A compatibility-based application. 

This full-stack site will take in results from users' survey responses, then compares the answers with the answers that the Stranger Things characters would have selected (according to me). The app will then display the name and picture of the Stranger Things character with the closest overall match. _Rememebr, friends don't lie_
